Also, this route will only be accessible to a user belonging to the _admin_ group.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned RESTful support is only partially implemented as we still need to be able to consume other formats, like JSON for example. This will be added with CR1 and full support will exist in 1.0.0. \r\n\r\nWe would be more than happy to answer any questions you might have, and encourage you to try the [demo on OpenShift](https://controller-aerogear.rhcloud.com/aerogear-controller-demo/).
