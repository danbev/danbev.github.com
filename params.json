The number of elements returned is referred to as a page. In AeroGear controller the strategy used for implementing pagination is using an offset/limit:\r\n* ```offset```  \r\n  The offset of the first element that should be included in the returned collection. Default value is _0_.\r\n* ```limit```  \r\n  The number of elements that should be returned. Default value is _10_.\r\n\r\nLet's look at an example of what a Route with an endpoint that supports pagination looks like:\r\n```java\r\nroute()\r\n      .from(\"/cars\")\r\n      .on(RequestMethod.GET)\r\n      .produces(JSON)\r\n      .to(Cars.class).findCarsBy(param(PaginationInfo.class), param(\"color\"));\r\n```\r\n```PaginationInfo``` is used to avoid having to add the params for ```offset``` and ```limit``` which would otherwise have been required:\r\n```java\r\n.to(Cars.class).findCarsBy(param(\"offset\"), param(\"limit\"), param(\"color\"));\r\n```\r\nThis might not look too bad, but imaging that you need to specify several query parameters in addition to ```color``` in the example above, and it can get pretty messy. So, instead we use the ```PaginationInfo``` type which it will be populated with the request values which are then available to the target method. This information can then be used by the endpoint target method to return a paged collection of data.\r\n  \r\nThe target endpoint method is annotated and this is where pagination can be configured:\r\n```java\r\n@Paginated \r\npublic List<Car> findCarsBy(PaginationInfo paginationInfo, String color) {\r\n    return getCars(paginationInfo.getOffset(), color, paginationInfo.getLimit());\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n[@Paginated](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-controller/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jboss/aerogear/controller/router/rest/pagination/Paginated.java) has options that can be overridden. For example, you can specify that you want to use different names of the query parameters than the default ```offset```, ```limit```, and that you'd like to use custom headers instead of default Web Linking (more about this shortly).  \r\n  \r\nThe source for [findCarsBy](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-controller-demo/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jboss/aerogear/controller/demo/Cars.java#L83) and the other examples in this post are part of [aerogear-controller-demo](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-controller-demo). \r\n\r\nRelated to pagination is also the ability to navigate, to get to the next/previous page. By default [Web Linking](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988) is used to provide links to the next and previous pages as appropriate. \r\nExample of a HTTP response with Web Linking:\r\n```bash\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nLink: \r\n<http://controller-aerogear.rhcloud.com/aerogear-controller-demo/cars?offset=0&color=red&limit=5>; rel=\"previous\",  \r\n<http://controller-aerogear.rhcloud.com/aerogear-controller-demo/cars?offset=10&color=red&limit=5>; rel=\"next\"  \r\nContent-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Length: 200\r\n[\r\n      {\"color\":\"red\",\"brand\":\"Mazda\",\"id\":41},\r\n      {\"color\":\"red\",\"brand\":\"Mini\",\"id\":48},\r\n      {\"color\":\"red\",\"brand\":\"Nissan\",\"id\":55},\r\n      {\"color\":\"red\",\"brand\":\"Opel\",\"id\":62},\r\n      {\"color\":\"red\",\"brand\":\"Scoda\",\"id\":69}\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWeb Linking can be disabled in favor of the perhaps simpler option of custom headers as mentioned above using the [@Paginated](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-controller/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jboss/aerogear/controller/router/rest/pagination/Paginated.java) annotation.\r\n\r\n### Consuming/Producing custom media types ###\r\nThis support enables specifying that a route can consume a custom media type, or produce a custom media type, or both.  \r\nFor example:\r\n```java\r\nroute()\r\n      .from(\"/cars\")\r\n      .on(RequestMethod.POST)\r\n      .consumes(CUSTOM_MEDIA_TYPE)\r\n      .produces(CUSTOM_MEDIA_TYPE)\r\n      .to(Cars.class).save(param(Car.class));\r\n```\r\nThe above example declares that this route will be able to consume and produce a custom media type. You can specify multiple media types for both the ```consumes``` and the ```produces``` method. The client uses the HTTP ```Accept``` header to specify what type it wants the server to respond with. \r\n\r\n#### Adding a Custom consumer ####\r\nA consumer is added to the system by adding a class that implements the [Consumer](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-controller/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jboss/aerogear/controller/router/Consumer.java) interface. This will be picked up by the CDI container and registered for that specific content type. \r\n\r\n#### Adding a Custom Producer/Responder ####\r\nAdding a producer/responder currently differs from adding a consumer. The reason for this is that we discovered the need to be able to respond to the same media type in different ways.  \r\nFor example, a client may request that it ```Accept: text/html```. But the route could choose to respond with either a dynamically generated JSP, or a static HTML page.  \r\n  \r\nSo, let's take a look at what is required to implement a custom media type responder that returns data in a custom format to the caller, as opposed to forwarding the responds to a view:\r\n```java\r\npublic class CustomResponder extends AbstractRestResponder {\r\n    \r\n    public static final MediaType CUSTOM_MEDIA_TYPE = new MediaType(\"application/custom\", CustomResponder.class);\r\n\r\n    public CustomResponder() {\r\n        super(CUSTOM_MEDIA_TYPE);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void writeResponse(Object entity, RouteContext routeContext) \r\n        throws Exception {\r\n        HttpServletResponse response = routeContext.getResponse();\r\n        response.getWriter().write(\"CustomResponder returned: \" + entity);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf you also implement [Responder](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-controller/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jboss/aerogear/controller/router/Responder.java) directly if you have the need to forward to a view instead of responding of if you simply prefer to implement an interface or can't extend.  \r\n\r\n  \r\nWe would be more than happy to answer any questions you might have, and encourage you to try the demo on [OpenShift](https://corscontroller-aerogear.rhcloud.com/aerogear-controller-demo/).

Also, this route will only be accessible to a user belonging to the _admin_ group.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned RESTful support is only partially implemented as we still need to be able to consume other formats, like JSON for example. This will be added with CR1 and full support will exist in 1.0.0. \r\n\r\nWe would be more than happy to answer any questions you might have, and encourage you to try the [demo on OpenShift](https://controller-aerogear.rhcloud.com/aerogear-controller-demo/).
